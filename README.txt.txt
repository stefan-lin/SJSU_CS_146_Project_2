Fixed List:

X  (1) Fixed delete method in BST  --- wasn't able to delete root node properly
X  (2) Added comments to BST.java






TO-DO List:
   (1) write a better print method for BST
   (2) Maybe let nodes in BST also are able to keep tracking its height/position in the tree; this may bring two advantages -
         a. For printing height 5 tree, we don't need to have a fixed input order. We can call a function "(maybe called) get_tree_height()" to
            find the height of the root node(equals to the height of the BST). In this way, we can just have a loop that keep inserting new
            random values into tree until the tree reaches height 5.
         b. In print method, we can easily know the position of each node. (replacing the print_count variable)
